  "summary": "Completed comprehensive Phase 2 testing of ESP32 Fleet Manager REAL PlatformIO Build Service. Backend successfully compiles actual ESP32-C3 firmware with PlatformIO, generates real .bin artifacts (166KB), computes SHA-256 hashes, creates signed OTA manifests (RSA-2048 + SHA-256), and serves binary files. Frontend fully functional with all 8 pages accessible and build terminal working.",
